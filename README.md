**Corrando Alfano**: <br>
He was my tutor for the week and he helped me a great deal with setting up my local storage. He guided me to really take a look at how I set up my HTML code and to maybe build this code into jQuery. This is deff something I will be trying on my spare time. 


**Andrew Truong (TA)**: <br>
lately I have been having a hard time voiceing my concernes about how behind I feel. Espcially when it comes to terminology with new concepts. He was really patient with me during one of the office hours when I asked him to explain the logic of setting up a funciton and the **for** loops required for the part of the assignment.
